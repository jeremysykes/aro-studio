# Assumptions

Track assumptions explicitly so they can be tested.

Format:
- Assumption:
  - Status: untested | tested | invalidated
  - Evidence:
  - How to test next:

## Current assumptions
- Designers/product users will prefer a Spectrum-styled “tool” UI over a bespoke white-label UI.
  - Status: untested
  - Evidence: Goal is reduced implementation overhead + familiar pro-tool feel.
  - How to test next: Record a short walkthrough and get feedback from 2–3 target users.

- Token editing will primarily happen via a table UI, with JSON as an escape hatch.
  - Status: untested
  - Evidence: Token grids are faster for non-engineers.
  - How to test next: Implement MVP grid flows and observe friction points.
