# Project context

## Product

Aro Studio is a desktop-first suite for design-system automation:

- Aro Tokens (token editor)
- Aro Validate
- Aro Sync (Figma sync later)
- Aro Build (package builder)
- Aro Proof (proof publisher)
- Aro Run (AI runner)

## Target users

Creatives and product people first. Engineers second.
UI must feel like white-label design software, not a dev dashboard.

## Current token storage

Tokens live at repo root in:
`tokens/<bu-name>/tokens.json`

This structure must be preserved.

## Long-term constraints

- Desktop now, web later
- Core must be portable
- Licensing should support monetization later
