# IP and licensing strategy

This repo is intended to be monetized in the future.

## Default stance for MVP

If the repo is public and you want maximum IP control:

- Use a proprietary license (All rights reserved).
- Do not add an OSI open-source license unless you intend to allow copying and forks.

## What to include now

At repo root:

- LICENSE (proprietary, All rights reserved)
- NOTICE (copyright statement)
- CONTRIBUTING (no external contributions without written permission)

## Future monetization options

- Dual licensing (commercial + open source for limited parts)
- Source-available licensing for app code, paid license for commercial use
- Open-core: keep `packages/core` proprietary, open a thin demo layer

## Cursor constraint

Cursor MUST NOT change LICENSE or legal text unless explicitly instructed.
